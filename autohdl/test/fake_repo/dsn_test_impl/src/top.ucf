# This file is a general .ucf for Nexys2 rev A board
# To use it in a project:
# - remove or comment the lines corresponding to unused pins
# - rename the used signals according to the project

# Signals Led<7>…Led<4> are assigned to pins which change type from s3e500 to other dies using the same package
# Both versions are provided in this file.
# Keep only the appropriate one, and remove or comment the other one.
